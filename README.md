# Dog-Breed-Classifier-CNN-Project

Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree: CNN Project

In this project, I have implemented a classifier to distinguish between humans and dogs and detect the dog breeds using convolutional neural networks. To increase the accuracy of the model, I have used transfer learning based on InceptionV3 architecture.
